## Introduction
The Bitset Project provides a custom Bitset class that enables you to work with collections of bits in a fixed-size array. It allows you to perform essential operations like setting specific bits, resetting bits, flipping bits, and reversing the order of bits in the bitset. This implementation offers an efficient and compact representation of binary data.
## Installation
To use the Bitset Project, follow these steps:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Change directory to the project folder.
- Include the "bitset.hpp" header file in your C++ project to access the Bitset class.
## Supported_Operations
The Bitset class supports the following operations:
- set(index): Sets the bit at the given index to 1.
- reset(index): Resets (clears) the bit at the given index to 0.
- resize(): Doubles the capacity of the bitset.
- swap(i, j): Swaps the bits at indices i and j.
- flip(index): Flips (toggles) the bit at the given index.
- reverse(): Reverses the order of bits in the bitset.
- test(index): Checks the value of the bit at the given index.
